Abstract - developed a simple GUI based network
distribution system using the Java
programming language that can be used for a
group based server. The system
created is capable of allowing new members to
connect given that they input their ID and
provide the port and IP of the server.
Also provided the ability to send private
messages to individual users or send messages
to every user that is connected to the network. Was able to assign a role called the
coordinator to maintain the active state of the
group, and re-assign the role if the current
coordinator leaves.
